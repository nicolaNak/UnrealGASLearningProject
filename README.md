This is my work following the Udemy tutorial found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg/

It is a mix of C++ and BP to set up the Gameplay Ability System to control an RPG.

I also used this project to apply some learning/test environment queries on the enemy AI. Due to this the enemies AI systems do not work properly.

I am about 75% through the tutorial as of 08/10/2025.
